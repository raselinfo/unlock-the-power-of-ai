Pakistan was created in 1947, when India was partitioned into two countries because of the mass migration of Muslims to Pakistan and Hindus and Sikhs to India (for more on partition, see Chapter 9). Bengal was given to Pakistan. Its capital, Dhaka, became the capital of East Pakistan.\\n> \\n> In the 1950s, when Pakistan\\'s Prime Minister Ali Khan became ill, General Ayub Khan staged a coup against him and declared himself the country\\'s new ruler. He established a military dictatorship and began to push for a \"Greater Pakistan\" that would include present-day Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Bangladesh.\\n> \\n> The result was war with India in 1965 and again in 1971, which resulted in the creation of Bangladesh, or East Pakistan, as it called itself. The war was an ugly one, resulting in the persecution of Hindus and others who were seen as enemies of Islam in Pakistan.
